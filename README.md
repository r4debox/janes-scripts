Yes, you're probably correct. Feel free to "Not use it" and there is a pull button to "Make it better".
# Scripts Overview

This repository contains a variety of utility scripts for Windows and Linux. Below is a brief description of each script (excluding the fonts and obfu tools).

## Batch Scripts

- **audio.bat**  
  Restarts Windows audio services by stopping and starting the *audiosrv* and *AudioEndpointBuilder* services.

- **convert.bat**  
  A multi-option media conversion tool using ffmpeg. It offers features like:
  - Adding music to mp4 files
  - Converting mp4 to webm (for sites like 4chan)
  - Converting webm to mp4
  - Generating GIFs, MOV files, and more

- **converto.bat**  
  An alternative version of the conversion script with additional options such as:
  - Converting mp4 to mp3
  - Creating “clickbait” videos
  - Other conversion utilities similar to *convert.bat*

- **image.bat**  
  Processes images using ImageMagick. It prompts for:
  - An image file
  - A HEX color or color name to set as transparent
  - A fuzz percentage for refining the transparency

- **obscure.bat**  
  Obfuscates a URL by converting its hostname to a decimal IP address and appending a fake login. It supports a debug mode for intermediate output.

## Python Scripts

- **noaasnow.py**  
  Uses Selenium to download NOAA satellite imagery. It navigates to a NOAA site, triggers a GIF download, and either sends the file to a webhook (if under 8MB) or compresses it using ffmpeg.

- **spectroex.py**  
  An advanced audio visualization and analysis tool built with PyQt5, librosa, and matplotlib. It offers multiple visualization modes (e.g., STFT, MFCC, Chromagram) and interactive analysis features.

- **forensimage.py**  
  An interactive image forensics and visualization tool built with PyQt5, PIL, and matplotlib. It allows you to load an image and apply various processing modes (e.g., grayscale, edge detection, Fourier transform, error level analysis) and supports chaining multiple operations via sequential analysis, with adjustable parameters for in-depth forensic investigations.

## Other Files

- **a.mp3**  
  A sample audio file used for testing and by the conversion scripts.

- **config.txt**  
  A configuration file listing media files used by the conversion scripts.

- **dargath**
